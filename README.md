# Private-OptiSwap

This is a proof of concept implementation for a paper submitted to ACM-CCSW 2021.
This project uses the pinocchio compiler at https://github.com/corda/msr-vc/tree/master/pinocchio to generate and execute arithmetic circuits.
This project also uses a modified version of Python Port of MerkleTools https://github.com/Tierion/pymerkletools as one of the packages to make merkle trees.
It is modified to use the Web3 python SHA3 hash function compatible with the SHA3 hash function available in the Solidity programming language.
